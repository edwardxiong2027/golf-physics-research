- **Journal of Emerging Investigators (JEI)** - Peer-reviewed, open access
- **Journal of High School Science (JHSS)** - Accepts original research

## RESEARCH TOPIC OPTIONS

Below are 5 unique, original research ideas ranked by feasibility and novelty:

---

### OPTION 1: RECOMMENDED
# "Stochastic Modeling of Optimal Golf Strategy: A Risk-Reward Analysis Using PGA Tour ShotLink Data"

**Uniqueness Score: 9/10** | **Feasibility: 9/10**

#### Abstract
This study applies probability theory and expected value calculations to analyze optimal decision-making in golf. Using publicly available PGA Tour ShotLink data, we model the risk-reward tradeoffs of aggressive vs. conservative play on par-5 holes, quantifying when "going for it" maximizes expected strokes gained.

#### Why This is Original
- Most golf physics papers focus on ball flight; this combines **game theory + statistics + physics**
- No published high school research uses ShotLink data for strategic optimization
- Directly applicable to real-world decision-making

#### Physics/Math Involved
- Probability distributions (shot dispersion modeling)
- Expected value calculations
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Regression analysis
- Physics of lie angle effects on shot outcomes

#### Data Sources
- PGA Tour ShotLink data (freely available for research)
- Your own round data collected via GPS tracking apps

#### Hypothesis
"On par-5 holes with water hazards, aggressive strategy (going for green in 2) has lower expected strokes gained than conservative play (laying up) when driving distance exceeds 290 yards and fairway width exceeds 35 yards."

### OPTION 2: HIGHLY ORIGINAL
# "The Fractal Dimension of Golf Swing Paths: Quantifying Repeatability Using Smartphone Accelerometer Data"

**Uniqueness Score: 10/10** | **Feasibility: 7/10**

#### Abstract
This research applies fractal geometry to analyze golf swing consistency. Using smartphone accelerometer data collected during practice sessions, we calculate the fractal dimension of swing paths to develop a novel metric for swing repeatability that correlates with handicap.

#### Why This is Original
- **Never been done before** - fractal analysis of swing mechanics is completely novel
- Combines advanced mathematics with accessible technology
- Creates a new metric for swing analysis

#### Physics/Math Involved
- Fractal geometry and Hausdorff dimension
- Time series analysis
- Signal processing (filtering accelerometer data)
- Correlation analysis with performance metrics

#### Data Collection
- iPhone/Android accelerometer data (held or attached during swings)
- Video analysis for validation
- Handicap/scoring data for correlation

### OPTION 3: PHYSICS-FOCUSED
# "Temperature-Dependent Coefficient of Restitution in Golf Balls: Implications for Cold Weather Play"

**Uniqueness Score: 8/10** | **Feasibility: 8/10**

#### Abstract
This experimental study measures how golf ball elasticity changes with temperature by quantifying the coefficient of restitution (COR) across temperatures from 35°F to 95°F. We develop a predictive model for distance loss in cold conditions.

#### Why This is Original
- Quantitative study with original experimental data
- Practical applications for all golfers
- Combines controlled experiment with predictive modeling

#### Physics/Math Involved

**Uniqueness Score: 8/10** | **Feasibility: 6/10**

#### Abstract
Using 2D video analysis software, this study estimates ground reaction forces during the golf swing and correlates force application timing with clubhead speed, identifying the optimal sequencing for power generation.

#### Why This is Original
- Makes biomechanics accessible without expensive equipment
- Develops methodology for amateur analysis
- Connects physics principles to performance

#### Physics/Math Involved

### OPTION 5: ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSICS
# "Atmospheric Effects on Golf Ball Flight: A Multi-Variable Analysis of Altitude, Humidity, and Temperature"

**Uniqueness Score: 7/10** | **Feasibility: 7/10**

#### Abstract
This study analyzes how atmospheric conditions affect golf ball flight distance by combining physics-based trajectory models with real-world data from launch monitors at different elevations and weather conditions.

#### Why This is Original
- Comprehensive multi-variable analysis
- Practical applications for golfers at all elevations
- Validates theoretical models with empirical data
